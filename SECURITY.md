## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email all found vulnerabilities to admin@blackfoxgaming.net. I check this email regularly for any updates regarding my repos. If the vulnerability you found is deemed
accurate we will patch it and include you in the patch notes. We will also release an issue fix at minimum a week afterwards informing people of the vulnerability
and to patch pull from the latest branch. If your vulnerability is found inaccurate we will review your findings in greater detail and why you think it is a vulnerability.
